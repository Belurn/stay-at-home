    <h3> <strong> Notable achievements </strong></h3>
    <h4> <strong> Designed, built and piloted a custop pod racer. 32 BBY Bonta Eve Classic Race Champion </strong></h4>
    <p class= "text1">In my spare time at Wald's Parts junk shop I designed and built a Class III open cockpit Podracer capable <br>

      of 588mph top speed. Went on to win the Boonta Eve Classic race in 32 BBY - first ever win by a human. <br> 
      Generated documented company revenue of over 59 wupiupi during the course of my enslavement.</p>
    <h3> <strong> Oversight of DS1 and DS2 Orbital Battle Situations construction projects </strong></h3>
    <p class= "text1"> During my tenure as a Supreme Imperial Fleet Commander I was in charge of large capital construction projects <br>
      for the Deep Space Fleet. Performed acceptance testing of the DS1 SuperLaser in 0 BBY by annihilating <br>
      Alderaan - a terrestrial class planet in the Core Worlds region. Succesfully tripled the deep space fire power of <br>
      the imperial fleet in accordance with the Tarkin Doctrine before losing both projects to run-away photon <br>
      torpedoes.
